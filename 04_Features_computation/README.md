# Features Computation


This part of the project receives the two types of data: pathogenic and non pathogenic protein sequences in fasta format and explores their possible features.
In tools folder new features are computed based on computational tools and public databases' filtering.

The new data are merged to the previously computed features that lie into pathogenic_dataset and non_pathogenic_dataset folders. These features were computed in [EnsembleGASVR]
(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261922806_EnsembleGASVR_A_novel_ensemble_method_for_classifying_missense_Single_Nucleotide_Polymorphisms)
and are recomputed and used in this project
